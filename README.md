# **espressOrders** 

[View espressOrders website ](https://ab79-espressorders-dev.herokuapp.com/)

his espressOrders website has been produced by Andrew Boyd as a Milestone Project 4 for the Code Institute’s Full Stack Web Development course.

They seem to be everywhere you look these days - coffee carts!
From little trucks to converted horse boxes they are popping up everywhere - from beauty spot carparks, to the beach and even at kids football matches. The "post-covid" work office seems also to have created a coffee cart culture and it is this that I hope the espressOrders application will tap into.

The purpose of espressOrders is to allow ordering from your favourite coffee cart ahead of time - to beat that inevitable queue! 

The website aims to allow users to select a coffee cart and browse drinks are available from that cart; allow users to make their selection and customise their order and then pay for it within espressOrders site.
